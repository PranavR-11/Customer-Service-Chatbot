# Customer-Service-Chatbot
Aim of the project was to demonstrate the working of a Chatbot which has an option to hand off to a Customer Support agent on demand.
The setup was three terminals with one running the Server, One Customer and One CS Agent. 
It is a python based Client-Server along with RE(regex) library for evaluating similar sentances by the Bot in order to respond to the customer.
